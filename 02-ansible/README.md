## Lab 2 - Build and maintain rules in Dynamic Layer and a enterprise policy with IAC using Ansible   
**Done**: Go to next lab in 02-ansible folder by executing this command
```bash
cd ~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/
```

### Task 1 - Add latest Check Point Gaia ansible collection

Install the Gaia collection with this command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install check_point.gaia
```

### Task 2 - Work with Self-Managed Security Gateways and add objects and rules to a Dynamic Layer
R82 introduced a new Dynamic Layer in the Access Control policy to assist customers with highly automated network â€Ženvironments.
This Policy Layer serves as a container for rules created directly on the Security Gateway using the Gaia API call "**set-dynamic-content**", catering to environments where provisioning, configuration, and other IT processes are regularly managed through APIs or Infrastrucutre As Code.

The Dynamic Layer works as a container for rules that you configure on the Security Gateway. You can fill this container with rules using in our case the "**cp_gaia_dynamic_content**" Ansible module and instruct Ansible to update the Security Gateway directly.

For your convenience and to save time a dynamic layer named "**GW1 Dynamic Layer**" is already created and applied as an inline layer to the policy **gw1-policy-package**.

This policy is already installed on GW1
<br><img width="169" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1246cb-7d43-4170-8919-3fa3ab187158" />

1. Open a command prompt on the windows client and try to ping google DNS on 8.8.8.8. As you see you are not able to reach the server since there is no rule in place accepting the traffic
<br><img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71f2961f-db24-4301-b3f9-808bd5cf9b88" />

2. Fill the Dynamic Layer with rules and objects from this playbook **dynamic-Layer.yml** via ansible using the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook dynamic-Layer.yml -i inventory.yml
```
3. While ansible is working you can open the two files used in this process to review them
   * dynamic-Layer.yml - This is the playbook containing the task to execute the cp_gaia_dynamic_content module
   * GW1-Dynamic-Layer.json - This is the json structured file containing the information  of objects and rules we want to fill the dynamic layer with.

4. Once ansible have executed the task successfully.
<br><img width="469" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79defe1e-2e1b-416f-851b-fa6020fdf145" />

5. You should now be able to see that you are able to ping google DNS on 8.8.8.8. 
<br><img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84cb5e8-aa68-4dc9-b5bf-b781fa6be9b4" />

6. There will be a log entry showing that this traffic has been accepted by access rule name **Allow ICMP from Windows Client** in layer name **GW1 Dynamic Layer**
<br><img width="569" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e074b10-f492-409c-b00f-cbf98afd27cf" />

7. In the same way as changes are audited when editing the policy on the management server, you can in the same audit log see the changes that were made to the dynamic layer over the API towards the Security Gateway.

### Task 3 - Add latest Check Point management ansible collection
Install the Management collection with this command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install check_point.mgmt
```
If you get an notification that "Nothing to do. All requested collections are already installed" run the install of the collection again using `--force`
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install check_point.mgmt --force
```

### Task 4 - Deploy the enterprise policy using Ansible
You are now ready to deploy and maintain an enterprise policy using ansible
1. Review **inventory.yml**, as you can see we are using the environment variables to authenticate.
<br>The below command will open the **~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/inventory.yml** file in Visual Studio code 
```bash
code ~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/inventory.yml
```

2. Deploy an enterprise policy from this playbook **demo-policy-playbook.yml** via ansible using the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook demo-policy-playbook.yml -i inventory.yml
```

3. In order to save some time, we will while the enterprise policy is being built continue to **Task 4**.

### Task 5 - Create and change your own object using ansible
To save some time we will use another playbook file in order not run through all the tasks again.
1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio code by clicking on the **+** sign in the lower right corner of VS code.
<br><img width="369" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec2f7c13-ba42-4ab4-bd8e-9694633518a3" />

2. Go to the 02-ansible folder by executing this command:
```bash
cd ~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/
```

3. Open the file **myobjects/main.yml** and review the code in there
<br>The below command will open the **~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/myobjects/main.yml** file in Visual Studio code
```bash 
code ~/CPX-2025-automation-ws/02-ansible/myobjects/main.yml
```
In the example we are creating a VPN community of type meshed with color red:
```yaml
- name: add-vpn-community-meshed
  cp_mgmt_vpn_community_meshed:
    name: Jims VPN Community by Ansible
    state: present
    color: red
    encryption_method: prefer ikev2 but support ikev1
    encryption_suite: custom
    ike_phase_1:
      data_integrity: sha1
      diffie_hellman_group: group-19
      encryption_algorithm: aes-128
    ike_phase_2:
      data_integrity: aes-xcbc
      encryption_algorithm: aes-gcm-128
    auto_publish_session: true
```
>[!NOTE]
> ```auto_publish_session: true``` will publish the changes for this task when it is being executed

4. Save the changes to the file by pressing `ctrl+s`
5. Run the playbook **myobject-playbook.yml**
```bash
ansible-playbook myobject-playbook.yml -i inventory.yml
```
In the terminal window monitor the execution of the playbook. Note the order in which objects in IaC files are deployed.
<br>What do you think will happen if you will interrupt the execution of playbook and re-run it?

6. Go to  Web Smart Console **"admin/Cpwins1!"**, see the changes applied by Ansible.
<br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bc15524-1d4d-4e21-9ea7-dec2d867483c)

### Task 6 - Test idempotency of your playbook and the modules
1. Re-run the playbook **myobject-playbook.yml**, you will see that the modules are **idempotent**. Since your ansible code (desired state) is equal to the reality (current state). no change is made and ansible responds with ok
```bash
ansible-playbook myobject-playbook.yml -i inventory.yml
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/173dea57-bcab-4ecc-9eb3-188875f48977)

>[!NOTE]
> A request method is considered **idempotent** if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request.

### Task 7 - Change your ansible playbook and review the changes
1. Change the color to `color: sea green` for the object in **myobjects/main.yml**
2. Save the changes to the file by pressing `ctrl+s`
3. Re-run the playbook, notice that the status reported for the task is "changed: [R82mgmt]".
```bash
ansible-playbook myobject-playbook.yml -i inventory.yml
```

4. Go to Web Smart Console **"admin/Cpwins1!"**, see the changes applied by Ansible.

### Task 8 - Remove the object by making it absent
1. Set the state of the object in **myobjects/main.yml** to absent
```yaml
state: absent 
```
2. Re-run the playbook myobject-playbook.yml 
```bash
ansible-playbook myobject-playbook.yml -i inventory.yml
```

3. Go to Web Smart Console **"admin/Cpwins1!"**, check what happened with your object.
<br>What does `state: absent` mean?

### Task 9 - Review the enterprise policy that was created using Ansible
1. Use the Browser to go to Web SmartConsole **"admin/Cpwins1!"**, see the changes applied by Ansible. 
<br>You should see new gateways as well as a Branch office and Corporate policy similar to SmartConsole demo mode:
<br><img width="469" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b417594-5cd5-4244-b17e-05909615f5fa" />

**Done**: If you have some spare time you can go to https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/namespaces/check_point/, pick an example from the management collection list and try to create that object with Ansible, or make some changes to your terraform configuration to see what happens.
